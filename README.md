kDecals is a system for definition and placement of forward projector Decals in Unity. It comes with a selection of common Decal render types by default and has a flexible `DecalDefinition` API for defining custom decals using custom shaders and C# property declaration. kDecals supports Decal creation in Editor and runtime and supports pooling of runtime decals by default.
